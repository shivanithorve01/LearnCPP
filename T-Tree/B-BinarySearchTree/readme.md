## AVL Tree
- AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node maintains extra information called a balance factor whose value is either -1, 0 or +1.
- Balance factor of a node in an AVL tree is the difference between the height of the left subtree and that of the right subtree of that node.

### AVL Rotation
- Left rotation(L) : In left rotations, every node moves one position to left from the current position.
- Right rotation(R) : In right rotations, every node moves one position to right from the current position. 
- Left Right rotation(LR) : In left right roation, First every node moves one position to the left, then one position to the right from the current position. 
- Right Left rotaton(RL) : In right left rotation, First every node moves one position to the right, then one position to the left from the current position.

### Algorithm for insertion
- Insert a new element into the tree using BST's (Binary Search Tree) insertion logic.
- After inserting the element check the Balance Factor of each node.
- When the balance factor of any node comes other than the three values(0,1,-1) then the tree is said to be unbalanced. Then perform the suitable Rotation to make it balanced.
  - If there is an imbalance in the left child's right sub-tree, perform a left-right rotation
  - If there is an imbalance in the left child's left sub-tree, perform a right rotation
  - If there is an imbalance in the right child's right sub-tree, perform a left rotation
  - If there is an imbalance in the right child's left sub-tree, perform a right-left rotation

### Algorithm for deletion
- If the node to be deleted is a leaf node, it is simply removed from the tree.
- If the node to be deleted has one child node, the child node is replaced with the node to be deleted simply.
- If the node to be deleted has two child nodes then,
  - Either replace the node with it’s inorder predecessor , i.e, the largest element of the left sub tree.
  - Or replace the node with it’s inorder successor , i.e, the smallest element of the right sub tree.
- If the tree is unbalanced, then perform the suitable rotation to make it balanced.
  - If there is an imbalance in the left child's right sub-tree, perform a left-right rotation
  - If there is an imbalance in the left child's left sub-tree, perform a right rotation
  - If there is an imbalance in the right child's right sub-tree, perform a left rotation
  - If there is an imbalance in the right child's left sub-tree, perform a right-left rotation

### Algorithm for search
- First compare the searching element with root, if less than root, then recursively call left subtree, else recursively call right subtree. 
- If the element to search is found anywhere, return true, else return false. 

### Properties
- Time complexity
  - insertion : O(logn)
  - deletion : O(logn)
  - search : O(logn)
 - Space complexity : O(n)

### Advantages
- AVL tree has capabilities of self-balancing
- AVL trees have efficient search time complexity

### Disadvantages
- AVL trees are very difficult to implement

# Array to bst
- A binary search tree follows some order to arrange the elements. 
- In a Binary search tree, the value of left node must be smaller than the parent node, and the value of right node must be greater than the parent node.  
- A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

## Properties
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

## Algorithm
- To check if a tree is height-balanced, get Get the Middle of the array and make it root.
- Get the middle of left half and make it left child of the root created in step 1.
- Get the middle of right half and make it right child of the root created in step 1.
- Return true if difference between heights is not more than 1 and left and right subtrees are balanced, otherwise return false. 

## Searching in Binary search tree
- First, compare the element to be searched with the root element of the tree.
- If root is matched with the target element, then return the node's location.
- If it is not matched, then check whether the item is less than the root element, if it is smaller than the root   element, then move to the left subtree.
- If it is larger than the root element, then move to the right subtree.
- Repeat the above procedure recursively until the match is found.
- If the element is not found or not present in the tree, then return NULL.

## Time Complexity

```

- Insertion	:- O(n)
- Deletion  :- O(n)
- Search    :- O(n)
- Space Complexity :- O(n)
```

## Advantages of Binary search tree

- Searching an element in the Binary search tree is easy as we always have a hint that which subtree has the desired element.
- As compared to array and linked lists, insertion and deletion operations are faster in BST.
- Many algorithms can be expressed more easily because it is just a binary tree.


## Disadvantages

- It employs recursive approach which requires more stack space.
- The interaction of binary search with memory hierarchy i.e. caching is poor.
